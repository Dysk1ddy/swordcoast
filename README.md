# Aethrune

Aethrune is a Python text adventure set in a dark frontier world shaped by roads, records, buried infrastructure, and systems that still function after their creators are gone.

The project is currently in an Aethrune retcon pass. The implementation still preserves existing save-sensitive scene IDs and quest IDs internally, but the public story direction is now original: Greywake, the Emberway, Iron Hollow, the Shatterbelt Frontier, the Vein of Glass, the Meridian Accord, the Quiet Choir, and the Ashen Brand.

## Current State

Act 1 is fully playable and Act 2 is playable as a scaffolded expedition campaign. The current build includes:

- Character creation, companions, party XP, inventory, equipment, leveling, relationship bonuses, trust-driven assists, and camp management.
- A route-driven Act 1 with background prologues, roadside branches, a frontier hub, branching expedition sites, hidden-route discovery, fortress assault, and a final descent.
- A scaffolded Act 2 with a claims council, expedition hub, pressure tracking, local maps, route-order consequences, companion recruitment, and Act 3 handoff flags.
- Turn-based combat with checks, initiative, grouped action menus, attacks, defenses, conditions, healing, death-state handling, class features, channel-like abilities, consumables, parley, fleeing, and chained encounters.
- A live map system for overworld travel and dungeon rooms, with Rich-powered panels when `rich` is installed and plain-safe output when the terminal is piped.
- Optional audio, typed narration, pacing controls, dice animation, compact save previews, a decision-ledger journal, party, inventory, equipment, sheet, camp, and settings commands.
- Context-aware command shelves appear under prompts so common commands stay visible during choice-heavy scenes.

## Aethrune Retcon Direction

The retcon keeps the existing engine and much of the original narrative spine while replacing legacy setting wrappers with Aethrune.

Key canon:

- Aethrune is a fractured land where control of movement, records, and infrastructure is power.
- The Meridian Accord was an old civilization that governed roads, waterworks, archives, signals, and outcomes.
- The Shatterbelt Frontier is the Act 1 surface region.
- The Emberway is the main route artery.
- Greywake is the major city opening.
- Iron Hollow is the frontier hub.
- The Vein of Glass and Resonant Vaults carry Act 2 into deeper Accord infrastructure.
- The Ashen Brand controls routes through force, false authority, and supply pressure.
- The Quiet Choir controls truth through records, signals, and listening systems.

Current public terminology:

- Classes currently display with their existing class names until the full class redesign pass.
- Ability labels are `Strength`, `Agility`, `Endurance`, `Intelligence`, `Wisdom`, and `Charisma`.
- Race labels preserve internal mechanics keys while displaying retcon names such as `Forged (Dragonborn)`, `Unrecorded (Gnome)`, `Astral Elf (Half-Elf)`, `Fire-Blooded (Tiefling)`, and `Riverfolk (Goliath)`.
- Preset quick-start characters now display as Aethrune-facing pairings such as `Riverfolk Barbarian`, `Astral Elf Bard`, `Orc Fighter`, `Dwarf Cleric`, `Unrecorded Wizard`, `Forged Paladin`, and `Fire-Blooded Sorcerer`.

## Running The Game

Easiest option on Windows:

```powershell
.\Play Aethrune.bat
```

Mouse-clickable window on Windows.
Kivy currently supports Python 3.13 for this project, so keep Python 3.14 installed and add Python 3.13 side-by-side:

```powershell
py -3.13 -m pip install -r requirements-gui.txt
.\Play Aethrune With Mouse.bat
```

You can also launch the clickable window directly:

```powershell
py -3.13 main.py --gui
```

Terminal option:

```powershell
pip install pygame rich
python main.py
```

`rich` is optional for gameplay logic but recommended for readable map and panel output.

Smoke-test friendly options:

```powershell
python main.py --plain --no-animation --no-audio --scripted-input scripted_input.txt
python main.py --plain --no-animation --no-audio --load-save Vale_act1_complete
python tools/prose_lint.py README.md
```

Useful CLI flags:

- `--plain`: force plain terminal output.
- `--gui`: open a mouse-clickable Kivy window with choice buttons.
- `--no-animation`: skip typed narration and dice pacing.
- `--no-audio`: disable sound startup and playback.
- `--load-save SLOT`: load a save slot at startup.
- `--scripted-input FILE`: read prompt answers from a file for smoke tests.

When stdin or stdout is piped, the game automatically disables Rich live menus, keyboard polling, box drawing, animations, and resize-aware rendering.

## AI-Assisted Writing

The repo includes an optional OpenAI-backed drafting tool for scene prose, dialogue, and lore revision. It is for authoring support only; runtime story logic stays deterministic in Python and data files.

Example:

```powershell
pip install openai
python tools/story_writer.py --brief "Rewrite this route-control exchange so it reads as Greywake and Emberway logistics without changing route logic." --scene-key blackwake_crossing --context dnd_game/gameplay/story_intro.py
```

Full setup and examples live in `information/systems/OPENAI_STORY_WRITER.md`.

The desktop wrapper can be launched with:

```powershell
python story_writer_studio.py
```

or by double-clicking `Launch Story Writer Studio.bat` on Windows.

## Map Flow

The current implementation preserves the existing route structure while the public names are being retconned.

Act 1 route target:

- Greywake opening
- Emberway road sequence
- Iron Hollow hub
- Blackglass Well and Red Mesa Hold branch sites
- Cinderfall Ruins optional relay strike
- Ashfall Watch assault
- Duskmere Manor descent
- Emberhall Cellars finale

Act 2 route target:

- Iron Hollow claims council
- Hushfen and the Pale Circuit
- Greywake Survey Camp
- Stonehollow Dig
- Glasswater Intake
- Broken Prospect and South Adit
- Resonant Vault Outer Galleries
- Blackglass Causeway
- Meridian Forge

## Testing

Core regression coverage:

```powershell
python -m pytest tests/test_core.py
```

Fast Act 2 content-smoke pass:

```powershell
python -m pytest -m smoke
```

During the retcon, some tests may continue to reference internal legacy IDs until the public text pass, display-name mappings, and save-safe migrations are complete.

## Useful In-Game Commands

The prompt shelf shows the most useful commands for the current context. Combat hides unavailable commands such as `map` and `camp`; exploration prompts show the broader shelf.

- `map`: open travel, overworld, and site maps when available.
- `journal`: open the decision ledger, clues, consequences, and companion trust notes.
- `party`: review active party stats and conditions.
- `inventory` / `backpack` / `bag`: manage shared items.
- `camp`: rest, talk, and use camp actions outside combat.
- `save`: create a named manual save.
- `saves` / `save files`: load or delete saves with compact metadata previews.
- `settings`: adjust audio and presentation toggles.
- `help`: show commands grouped by use; `quit` is listed last.
- `~` / `console`: open the developer console; `helpconsole` prints its command reference.
