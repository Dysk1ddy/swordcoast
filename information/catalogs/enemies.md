# Enemy Reference

This file documents every enemy archetype currently defined in the project, including fixed story enemies, optional background-prologue enemies, and post-combat random-encounter enemies.

The final section also includes a design appendix with proposed future enemies written to match the same reference style. Those appendix entries are concept-ready additions, not live archetypes wired into factories or encounter tables yet.

## Scope And Scan Notes

- Scanned sources:
  - `dnd_game/data/story/factories.py`
  - `dnd_game/gameplay/story_intro.py`
  - `dnd_game/gameplay/story_act1_expanded.py`
  - `dnd_game/gameplay/story_act2_scaffold.py`
  - `dnd_game/gameplay/random_encounters.py`
  - `dnd_game/gameplay/combat_flow.py`
  - `dnd_game/gameplay/combat_resolution.py`
  - `dnd_game/data/items/catalog.py`
  - `information/Story/ACT1_CONTENT_REFERENCE.md`
  - `information/Story/ACT2_CONTENT_REFERENCE.md`
- `android_port/` mirrors the same enemy factory roster and encounter structure; it does not add unique enemy archetypes.
- The `Design Expansion: 25 New Enemy Concepts` appendix at the end of this file is proposal content added for future implementation. Its archetypes are not part of the current scanned runtime roster.
- Gold below is the enemy's built-in `gold_value`, which is awarded on victory.
- Item drops below are probabilistic loot-table entries. If an enemy says "no item loot table", the code currently grants XP/gold only unless the scene also hands out a separate scripted reward.
- "Forced" means combat is part of the scene once you commit to it. "Potential" means it only appears in certain backgrounds, branch choices, party sizes, or failed random-encounter resolutions.

## Act 2 Thematic Expansion: Control Of Truth

These fifteen enemies are designed specifically around Act 2's core themes: control of truth, dangerous knowledge, false authority, expedition sabotage, corrupted custody, and listening-horror rising out of Resonant Vaults.

They are intentionally stronger than the existing Act 1 filler pool. Early Act 2 should already feel like fighting disciplined saboteurs, ritual specialists, warped cave predators, and old Meridian Compact defenses that have outlived their judgment.

### Expansion Summary

## Important Implementation Notes

- The combat engine keys special behavior off `archetype`, so renamed enemies like `Ashen Brand Fixer`, `Scrapling Cutthroat`, or `Cistern Eye` still use the same base enemy logic.
- Only Act 1 archetypes currently have item loot tables in `dnd_game/data/items/catalog.py`.
- Act 2 enemies still award their built-in gold values, but they do not currently roll item drops.
- Several major scenes also grant scripted environmental rewards that are not part of enemy drop tables:
  - Vaelith area: `scroll_lesser_restoration`
  - Brughor area: `greater_healing_draught`
  - Duskmere cistern area: `scroll_arcane_refresh`
  - Emberhall clerk event: `antitoxin_vial`

## Design Expansion: 25 New Enemy Concepts

These entries are designed to slot cleanly into the game's current status vocabulary and encounter style while drawing from frontier scavengers, Quiet Choir cells, engineered sentries, ruin predators, drowned revenants, and other Aethrune-aligned threat shapes.

They are ordered from easy to hard so you can lift early-game skirmishers, mid-tier specialists, or boss-grade threats as needed.
