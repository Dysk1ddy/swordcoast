# Aethrune Act 2 Content Reference

This file collects the approved design target for Act 2. Unlike `information/Story/ACT1_CONTENT_REFERENCE.md`, this is currently a planning and scaffolding document rather than a summary of already playable scenes, so it should be treated as the source of truth for future implementation work unless later story revisions replace it.

The tone and structure now target the original Aethrune frame: Iron Hollow politics, the Vein of Glass, the Resonant Vaults, and the Quiet Choir's attempt to control what the old systems remember.

## Act 2 Scope

- Opening arc: Act 1 aftermath -> Ashlamp claims council -> expedition sponsorship choice -> first lead
- Early branching route: dead-testimony circuit, Greywake Survey Camp, and `Stonehollow Dig`
- Early side-delve candidate: `Glasswater Intake` can slot between the first and second cleared early leads as a medium optional dungeon about water control, courier traffic, claims fraud, and the first practical signs of whisper contamination
- Early route rule: any two leads let the player trigger the midpoint, but delaying the third now causes a permanent consequence before that lead can be recovered later
- First new recruitable companion: `Nim Ardentglass` enters through `Stonehollow Dig`, but recruiting him late changes his trust and the quality of the recovered survey truth
- Midpoint convergence: sponsor tension -> sabotage night -> protect a priority and accept what slips through elsewhere
- Late branching route: `Broken Prospect` and `South Adit` are both required before the deeper cave, but can be taken in either order and materially wound each other when delayed
- Second new recruitable companion: `Irielle Ashwake` can be freed and recruited during `South Adit`, with stronger or weaker entry depending on how late the rescue comes
- Finale: `Resonant Vault Outer Galleries` -> `Blackglass Causeway` -> `Meridian Forge`
- Final boss: `Sister Caldra Voss`, a Quiet Choir cult agent using an obelisk shard to turn the Forge into a listening lens
- Total potential Act 2 combats should comfortably exceed 12 before counting random encounters
- Act 2 now tracks three structural pressures in the scaffold:
  - `Town Stability`: how intact Iron Hollow stays as a political and human community
  - `Route Control`: how much of the expedition map your side genuinely owns
  - `Whisper Pressure`: how much of the mine's wrong resonance is escaping containment

## Act 2 Throughline

- Varyn Sable's ledgers point to the Resonant Vaults and show how the Ashen Brand held the road. They kept prospectors, merchants, town leaders, and rival diggers off older Meridian routes until a better-prepared claimant arrived.
- The act opens as a frontier claims war. Under that noise, the Quiet Choir has an obelisk shard below the Vaults and knows the Meridian Forge can carry a listening signal through stone.
- Caldra Voss is tuning the Vaults into a resonant instrument. She wants an answer from farther down and farther away than any ordinary ruin should give.
- The act should unfold in layers:
  - as a political fight over who gets to name Iron Hollow's future
  - as an expedition race where incomplete information is more dangerous than monsters
  - as a ruin-crawl where old Meridian custody rules and the Quiet Choir are fighting to define the Vaults
  - with the cosmic wrongness fully visible near the end

## Act 1 Carryover

Act 2 opens with Act 1 choices already pressing on the opening metrics and later scene texture.

| Act 1 carryover | Typical source | Act 2 consequence |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `act1_victory_tier`, `act2_starting_pressure` | Act 1 ending state after Varyn falls | changes how strained Iron Hollow feels at the start of the expedition and how much immediate pressure the claims war opens under |
| `steward_vow_made`, `phandalin_council_seen` | choosing to speak for the town and help shape its defenses | raises starting `Town Stability`; the town enters the claims war with more nerve |
| `elira_helped` and whether Elira joined | shrine aid and recruitment | lowers starting `Whisper Pressure`; Agatha and Black Lake scenes become more grounded in mercy instead of panic |
| `miners_exchange_dispute_resolved`, `miners_exchange_ledgers_checked` | Act 1 Miner's Exchange path | raises starting `Route Control`; Halia is easier to justify as a sponsor, but the player also sees her more clearly |
| `act2_edermath_cache_routework` | recovering Daran Edermath's old adventurer's cache at the orchard | raises starting `Route Control`; Act 2 status text can cite the quiet orchard-to-highland control line |
| `early_companion_recruited` | Kaelis or Rhogar in Greywake | Kaelis improves route logic; Rhogar improves civic steadiness |
| `neverwinter_contract_house_political_callback` | spending contract-house intel in Blackwake or Mira's Greywake follow-up report | raises starting `Route Control`; Oren, Sabra, Vessa, and Garren create city-side witness pressure against copied road authority |
| `bryn_ledger_sold` vs `bryn_ledger_burned` | `Loose Ends` personal quest | selling the ledger pushes more pressure and distrust into the expedition opening; burning it makes the town start cleaner but poorer |
| `elira_mercy_blessing` vs `elira_hard_verdict` | `Faith Under Ash` personal quest | shapes whether frontier justice enters Act 2 as hopeful mercy or hard deterrence |
| Recruiting Bryn, Tolan, or Elira | Act 1 town companion work | each companion now supplies Act 2 sidetrack decisions that change later story pressure instead of only flavor text |

## Consequence Systems

- `Town Stability`
  - Represents whether Iron Hollow still acts like a community under stress or a marketplace under siege.
  - Low values mean panic, fractured aftermath, and a weaker Act 3 handoff.
  - High values mean survivor trust, better morale, and a stronger social base for later acts.
- `Route Control`
  - Represents how much clean survey truth, logistics, and trustworthy access your side actually possesses.
  - Low values mean rivals and cultists keep rewriting the map faster than you can.
  - High values mean you reach the cave on terms closer to your own.
- `Whisper Pressure`
  - Represents how much the mine's altered resonance has escaped into the act.
  - Low values mean the party is containing the Choir's influence.
  - High values mean the act ends with more obvious contamination feeding Act 3.
- `Sponsor Choice`
  - `Halia / Exchange`: faster routework, more leverage, more greed, higher risk of feeding the wrong parts of the race
  - `Linene / Lionshield`: steadier logistics, cleaner discipline, more defensible claims posture
  - `Elira + Daran / Wardens`: slower but morally firmer expedition, lower whisper seepage, stronger human consequences
- `Delayed Lead Rule`
  - Once the player advances to sabotage night with one early lead unresolved, that lead is marked as delayed.
  - The content remains recoverable later, but the damage of delaying it is already done and should never be fully undone.
- `Late Route Order`
  - `Broken Prospect` first means the route race improves while the prisoners suffer for the delay.
  - `South Adit` first means more captives live while rival claimants and cult sentries harden the route race elsewhere.

## Core Premise

- Varyn Sable's ledgers confirm that the Ashen Brand were not acting alone; they were keeping treasure hunters, miners, and local authorities away from older Meridian routes tied to the Resonant Vaults.
- Several factions now want what lies beneath the Vein of Glass:
  - honest miners and traders who want the region reopened
  - practical opportunists who want rights, salvage, and leverage
  - the Quiet Choir, a hidden cult cell studying a buried obelisk shard through the Vaults' lingering resonance
- The act should feel like a frontier recovery story giving way to an expedition race, then to a magical ruin crawl, and only near the end to unmistakable cosmic wrongness.

## Expanded Act 2 Route

1. Act 1 aftermath in Iron Hollow and a claims council at the Delvers' Exchange
2. Sponsor choice: decide whether speed, discipline, or caution defines the expedition's first tone
3. First lead selection and opening expedition prep
4. Optional side-delve: `Glasswater Intake` can open after the first cleared early lead as a medium dungeon that reshapes metrics and later route reads without replacing a core lead
5. Early lead A: dead-testimony circuit
6. Early lead B: Greywake Survey Camp
7. Early lead C: `Stonehollow Dig`
8. Once any two early leads are cleared, the player can trigger `Sabotage Night`
9. If the third lead is delayed, it remains playable later but its damage is already written into the campaign state
10. Midpoint convergence:
   the player chooses what to protect first in Iron Hollow and accepts a matching loss elsewhere
11. Late route A: `Broken Prospect`
12. Late route B: `South Adit`
13. The order of 11 and 12 materially changes captives, route posture, and companion texture
14. `Resonant Vault Outer Galleries`
15. `Blackglass Causeway`, now framed as a shrine / barracks / causeway-priority decision instead of a straight bridge fight
16. `Meridian Forge`
17. Act end summary records the shape of the victory and who paid for it

### Drafted Early Side-Dungeon

- `Glasswater Intake`
  - Best unlocked after the first cleared early lead and before `Sabotage Night`.
  - Functions as a medium optional dungeon that foreshadows the Resonant Vaults by way of waterworks, courier ledgers, claims fraud, and containment choices instead of full late-act spectacle.
  - Intended to carry 4 to 5 encounter beats, one real finale, and multiple metric-facing choices rather than reading like a throwaway side room chain.
  - Its final chamber can center on `Brother Merik Sorn`, a Quiet Choir field operator who treats water pressure, logistics discipline, and doctrine as the same system.
  - Full draft: `information/Story/ACT2_GLASSWATER_INTAKE_DRAFT.md`
- Additional branch-heavy location packets:
  - `information/Story/ACT2_LOCATION_BRANCH_PACKETS.md` collects deeper multi-stage branch webs for the dead-testimony circuit, Greywake Survey Camp, `Stonehollow Dig`, `Broken Prospect`, and Blackglass Causeway.
  - `information/Story/ACT2_CONYBERRY_AGATHA_DRAFT.md` is a legacy implementation draft for the dead-testimony circuit; keep only the warning-custody structure and replace old names during implementation.

## Choice Web

### Early lead consequences

- Delay the dead-testimony circuit
  - The player reaches sabotage night without the full warning.
  - `Whisper Pressure` rises and the southern adit stays less clearly mapped.
  - Recovering the circuit later still matters, but it becomes a damaged warning rather than a clean one.
- Delay Greywake Survey Camp
  - The saboteur line feeds directly into the midpoint riot.
  - `Town Stability` and `Route Control` both drop because the enemy reaches town through confusion and false routework.
  - Recovering the wood later stops future damage, but cannot erase the riot's cost.
- Delay `Stonehollow`
  - The survey truth reaches the party late and incomplete.
  - `Route Control` falls and `Whisper Pressure` rises because the deeper dig sat under resonance longer.
  - Nim can still be recruited, but his trust and the quality of his notes should reflect the delay.

### Midpoint priority consequences

- Save the claims hall first
  - Best for preserving policy, leadership, and civic structure.
  - Risks letting hidden knives escape in the smoke.
- Save the shrine lane and civilians first
  - Best for human cost and public trust.
  - Risks weakening the formal claims apparatus or sponsor confidence.
- Hunt the infiltrator cell first
  - Best for keeping the expedition map from being rewritten in secret.
  - Risks making the town feel abandoned in its most frightened hour.

### Late-route order consequences

- `Broken Prospect` first
  - Stronger route position, cleaner approach, firmer expedition leverage.
  - The player reaches `South Adit` later and sees more irreversible loss among the captives.
- `South Adit` first
  - More lives saved, stronger moral authority, better human memory of the expedition.
  - The route race hardens elsewhere and `Broken Prospect` becomes a meaner recovery scene.

## Hidden Truth Under The Resonant Vaults

- Old Meridian custody rules split access, route knowledge, and sacred obligations across many hands. The Vaults echoed well enough to profit from and dangerously enough that no single claimant was meant to hold the whole instrument alone.
- The Meridian Forge amplifies the intention fed into it. Careful hands can use it for repair and measured wonder. The Quiet Choir turns it into a listening lens aimed through the Vaults' natural resonance.
- Sister Caldra Voss should read like a field theologian of something cosmic and wrong. She believes mortals drown revelation in their own noise, so the Choir strips voices, bells, and witness away until the stone can answer.
- The horror of Act 2 is that she is partly right. The Vaults do answer. The problem is what answers back.
- This lets Act 3 escalate naturally:
  - if `Whisper Pressure` stayed low, Act 3 begins as containment after a near miss
  - if `Whisper Pressure` stayed medium, Act 3 begins with fragments already leaking into dreams, notes, and rituals
  - if `Whisper Pressure` stayed high, Act 3 begins with the party having carried part of the signal out themselves
  - if `act3_forge_route_state` is `mastered`, Act 3 begins with the Forge already broken across all three subroutes
  - if `act3_forge_route_state` is `broken` or `partial`, later scenes should remember exactly which Forge lines were actually cleared through `act3_forge_subroutes_cleared`
  - if `act3_forge_lens_state` is `mapped`, later dialogue can speak concretely about how Caldra held witness, ritual, and shard pressure together
  - if `act3_forge_lens_state` is `shattered_blind`, later scenes should work from rumor, damage patterns, and surviving echoes instead of a clean explanation

## New Companion Reference

| Companion | Race / Class | Summary | Recruitment point | Relationship bonuses |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Nim Ardentglass | Unrecorded Wizard | Pact cartographer and practical ruin scholar | joins after a rescue or breakthrough around `Stonehollow Dig` or the first early-route convergence | Great: `+1 Arcana`, `+1 Investigation`; Exceptional: `+1 spell attack` |
| Irielle Ashwake | Fire-Blooded Warlock | escaped cult augur trying to stay ahead of the whispers that marked her | freed during `South Adit` around the late-act 70 percent mark | Great: `+1 spell damage`, `+1 Insight`; Exceptional: `+1 WIS saves` |

### Scene support hooks

- Nim: `stonehollow_dig`, gives hero bonus and player Blessed
- Nim: `wave_echo_outer_galleries`, gives hero bonus and enemy Reeling; public text should call this the Resonant Vaults.
- Nim: `forge_of_spells`, reads support traffic aloud at the threshold so the Meridian Forge feels like routework as well as spectacle.
- Irielle: `south_adit`, gives hero bonus and player Invisible
- Irielle: `forge_of_spells`, gives hero bonus and enemy Frightened, and now speaks into the resonance-lens / counter-cadence reads directly.

## Companion Arc Hooks

Act 2 should deepen the whole party through optional side tracks that pull personal history into expedition work. Each arc needs a campaign-facing consequence that changes a pressure, later scene, or Act 3 setup flag.

| Companion | Optional quest id | Primary location | Theme | Decision | Persistent payoff |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Kaelis Starling | `ashes_in_the_boughs` | Greywake Wood | old scout loyalties, guilt, and the cost of reading danger too well | preserve a hidden trail or burn it | better route speed vs stronger town security |
| Rhogar Valeguard | `oath_beneath_stone` | sealed miners' chapel | oath, mercy, and whether duty means guarding relics or people first | anchor his oath in the town or the threshold | stronger civic stability vs lower whisper seepage |
| Tolan Ironshield | `last_wagon_standing` | Broken Prospect road | caravan memory, survivor anger, and whether pragmatism is moral enough | salvage tainted structure or destroy profitable wrongness | better route control vs cleaner spiritual state |
| Bryn Underbough | `false_ledgers` | Miner's Exchange / sponsor stores | smuggling instincts, bad old contacts, and choosing who gets trusted with the truth | quietly falsify bad ledgers or expose the scheme in public | better covert route leverage vs stronger civic trust |
| Elira Dawnmantle | `lantern_of_tymora` | dead-testimony chapel ruins | faith under pressure, grief, and whether hope is luck or discipline | carry the warding lantern into the field or leave it in town | lower whisper pressure vs higher town stability |
| Nim Ardentglass | `missing_theorem` | South Adit archive room | mentor legacy, academic pride, and whether knowledge is worth carrying out intact | preserve the dangerous theorem or burn its corrupted pages | stronger forge options vs safer Act 3 contamination profile |
| Irielle Ashwake | `starved_signal` | Blackglass shrine | resisting the cult's hold and deciding whether dangerous knowledge should be destroyed or studied | teach the counter-cadence or bury it | stronger forge opening vs cleaner containment into Act 3 |

### Quest state logic

- Quests should still use `active`, `ready_to_turn_in`, and `completed`
- Several Act 2 quests are conversation-triggered rather than purely location-triggered
- Companion arcs should journal separately from main quests so they do not crowd out the main expedition beats

## Random Encounter Pool: Act 2 Exclusive

These encounters are designed to be suspenseful, fast, and thematically aligned with expedition play, old mines, and creeping whisper-lore. They may lead to combat, but should just as often resolve through one or two meaningful choices.

Implementation note for later: add an act-scope field such as `act_exclusive` or `act_tags` so the existing road pool becomes `act1`, the entries below become `act2`, and the eventual cosmic pool can cleanly become `act3`.

## Debugging Pointers

- The early expedition route should allow any two of three leads to unlock the midpoint, but the third lead should remain recoverable later in a degraded state
- Delaying an early lead must apply its consequence exactly once when sabotage night begins, not every time the hub is revisited
- Nim's recruitment should remain available through several success paths, but `has_companion()` style checks should still prevent duplicates
- Companion side tracks should deepen the act without blocking the main route; they should alter one of the campaign pressures, a later scene, or an Act 3 setup flag
- `Broken Prospect` and `South Adit` should both become available after the midpoint and should not force a single canonical order anymore
- The route chosen first must change the second route's tone and stakes even if the player ultimately clears both
- Random encounters need act-tag filtering once exclusivity is implemented, or the Act 2 mood will get diluted by generic frontier road scenes
- Caldra Voss and Irielle Ashwake both point toward Act 3 lore; keep those reveal flags separate from the basic Act 2 completion path so the player can miss some foreshadowing without breaking progression
