# Aethrune Act 1 Content Reference

This file collects the current campaign-facing content that is most useful for debugging story flow, enemy setups, recruitment, and rewards.

For the compiled list of every Act 1 player-facing dialogue option, required conditions, and results, see `ACT1_DIALOGUE_REFERENCE.md`.

The summary sections at the top reflect the expanded Act 1 route and should be treated as the current source of truth where they differ from older shorter-arc notes later in the file.

## Act 1 Scope

- Opening arc: background prologue -> Wayside Luck Shrine -> Greywake Triage Yard -> Greywake Road Breakout -> Greywake briefing -> Emberway ambush -> cleared Emberway branch menu -> Iron Hollow hub
- Branching middle route: Blackglass Well and Red Mesa Hold can be tackled in either order, with a hidden optional strike into `Cinderfall Ruins`
- Convergence points: Ashlamp war-room event, Ashfall Watch assault, Iron Hollow lantern vigil
- Late route: Duskmere Manor -> `Emberhall Cellars`
- Named minibosses: `Vaelith Marr`, `Brughor Skullcleaver`, and `Rukhar Cinderfang`
- Final boss: `Varyn Sable`
- Total potential Act 1 combats now comfortably exceeds 10 before counting random encounters
- New support hubs: Greywake's contract house, Daran's orchard, the Delvers' Exchange, Ashlamp war-room, and the post-Ashfall lantern vigil. Daran's orchard now includes an optional old-cache stealth scene that becomes combat if the approach fails.
- Quest set currently defined in data: 13 Act 1 quests, including 5 inn quests across Greywake and Ashlamp, 6 wider town or road quests, and 2 companion personal quests
- Reactivity layer now tracks `Town Fear`, `Ashen Strength`, and `Survivors Saved`, then resolves Act 1 as `clean_victory`, `costly_victory`, or `fractured_victory`

## Expanded Act 1 Route

1. Background-specific opening encounter or shortcut, then shared Elira/Greywake sequence:
   Wayside Luck Shrine -> Greywake Triage Yard -> Greywake Road Breakout
2. Greywake setup, briefing, contract-house social hub, and optional Mira-assigned road companion
3. Emberway ambush and Tolan recruitment point, then a cleared-road travel choice with optional side branches into `Liar's Circle`, `False Roadwarden Checkpoint`, and `False Tollstones` before Iron Hollow
4. Iron Hollow arrival, inn / shrine / shop / steward loops, orchard / exchange hubs, and a possible early `Cinderfall` reveal on a strong `Insight` read
   - Orchard Wall can also reveal Daran's old adventurer's cache: a `Stealth` DC 12 route to recover `edermath_cache_compass`, or a watcher encounter on failure.
5. Blackglass Well route:
   dig-ring fight -> salt cart or supply trench branch -> Vaelith Marr miniboss
6. Red Mesa Hold route:
   outer shelf fight -> drover hollow or shrine ledge branch -> Brughor Skullcleaver miniboss
7. Optional `Cinderfall Ruins` route if the hidden relay is uncovered:
   collapsed gate -> ash chapel or broken storehouse -> ember relay node
8. Ashlamp war-room fixed event once both major side routes are cleared
9. Ashfall Watch route:
   gate fight -> prisoner yard / signal event -> lower barracks fight -> Rukhar miniboss
10. Lantern vigil fixed event back in Iron Hollow
11. Duskmere Manor route:
   cellar intake fight -> cistern event -> Cistern Eye roleplay boss / fight
   - Cistern Eye routes: kill it, trade a memory/truth/companion secret, bargain repeatedly, or deceive it.
   - Bargain and Deception routes can reveal Cinderfall relay context and Resonant Vault / Meridian Forge foreshadowing before Emberhall.
   - The risky routes apply sanity-style combat pressure, `Whispered Through`, and companion trust costs.
12. Emberhall finale:
   antechamber fight -> chained clerk / ledger event -> Varyn boss fight

### Quest state logic

- Quests are stored as `active`, `ready_to_turn_in`, or `completed`
- `ready_to_turn_in` is computed from completion flags, not from scene position alone
- The journal view groups quests by readiness and appends accepted, ready, and completed notes over time
- Bryn and Elira's personal quests are auto-granted from trust thresholds instead of a town giver menu

## Act 1 Reactivity State

### Global metrics

- `act1_town_fear`
  - default `2`
  - lowered by public reassurance, rescues, and mercy choices
- `act1_ashen_strength`
  - default `3`
  - reduced by clearing enemy outer sites and can be driven to `0` by `Cinderfall` sabotage
- `act1_survivors_saved`
  - default `0`
  - raised through rescue branches such as Blackglass, Red Mesa Hold, and Cinderfall

### Hidden route unlocks

- `Iron Hollow` arrival `Insight` success can reveal `Cinderfall Ruins`
- `Blackglass Well` supply trench notes can reveal `Cinderfall Ruins`
- `Red Mesa Hold` rescued-drover follow-up can reveal `Cinderfall Ruins`

### Ashfall consequences

- Destroying the `Cinderfall` ember relay removes one lower-barracks reinforcement and prevents `Rukhar` from opening with his `4` temp HP reserve edge
- Jerek Harl's `Bring Back Dain's Name` now resolves in the Ashfall prisoner-yard line, with a command-post paperwork fallback if the player reaches `Rukhar` first
- Decoding Nera's upstairs quiet-room packet adds a special Ashfall command option that spends stolen countersign intel against `Rukhar`
- Elira's `Faith Under Ash` resolution also feeds into Ashfall's boss setup:
  - mercy grants a later `Blessed` opener
  - hard judgment increases pressure and hardens the finale tone

### Ending tiers

- `clean_victory`: low fear, low Ashen strength, enough survivors saved, and no major strained companion fallout
- `costly_victory`: the middle state when Iron Hollow wins but carries visible damage or tension
- `fractured_victory`: high fear, high remaining enemy pressure, or a strained late-game moral path with too few rescues
- The game records `act2_starting_pressure` from these outcomes so Act 2 can open under different levels of strain

## Early Story Recruitment And Encounter Notes

### Pre-Greywake Elira and Greywake sequence

- Background prologues now converge at `Wayside Luck Shrine` before Mira Thann's briefing.
- Elira Lanternward is introduced as the first companion candidate.
- First Elira recruitment chance:
  - Wayside Luck Shrine after helping with poison, prayer, road marks, or triage flow.
  - Helping Elira makes recruitment automatic or much easier.
- Second Elira recruitment chance:
  - Greywake Triage Yard before the Greywake Road Breakout.
  - Stabilizing the wounded line lowers the recruitment DC.
- Greywake Triage Yard is the systemic escalation:
  - the intake board and manifest sort travelers into `treat`, `hold`, and `lost` before the wagons arrive
  - Elira frames the second recruitment chance as leaving triage to stop the hand moving those outcome marks
  - successful Insight, Medicine, or Persuasion routes create a concrete evidence kind for Mira: marked manifest, matched triage tags, or yard witnesses
- Greywake Road Breakout is the shared second major combat:
  - Ashen Brand cutters try to steal or burn an outcome-marked manifest.
  - Preserving the manifest can set `system_profile_seeded` and `varyn_route_pattern_seen`.
  - If Elira is recruited, she can bless the player before the fight.
  - If Elira is not recruited, she protects the wounded line and later appears at Iron Hollow's Lantern Shrine.

### Greywake briefing

- The player can choose:
  - Kaelis Starling
  - Rhogar Valeguard
- Elira may already be in the party before this choice; Mira's road companion can still be assigned afterward if party space allows.
- If the player carries Greywake proof into the briefing, Mira reacts directly: the evidence proves the Ashen Brand is coordinating outcomes, not merely causing damage.
  - Early Elira recruitment prompts Mira to note that the road is already worse than her reports.
  - A preserved manifest is treated as a schedule, not a forged report.
  - A burned manifest shifts the plan to witness testimony.
  - Protected wounded become angry, living witnesses.
- Oren Vale's contract house now acts as the city-side inn and social pressure valve before departure:
  - Oren Vale keeps the room, the witnesses, and the upstairs private arrangements
  - Sabra Kestrel grants `False Manifest Circuit`
  - Vessa Marr runs the card table and smoke-side rumor line
  - Garren Flint exposes how copied roadwarden cadence keeps getting obeyed
- `False Manifest Circuit` is a Greywake inn quest built from Oren, Vessa, and Garren's separate details, then turned back in to Sabra
- Completing Sabra's quest unlocks an upstairs private-room scene that turns contract-house politics into Blackwake and Emberway intelligence
- Oren/Sabra/Garren proof can also collapse the `False Roadwarden Checkpoint` before Blackwake, making the contract-house thread pay off on the road itself
- That private-room intel can be spent at Blackwake to corner Sereth Vane directly, then echoed through Mira's Greywake report if Oren, Sabra, Vessa, and Garren become public witnesses
- `Ash In The Ale` can break out in the room if the player mishandles Vessa's table or pushes Garren too hard

### Roadside Ambush

- Small parties receive encounter scaling help:
  - solo players get weakened enemies, temp HP, Blessed, and initiative help
  - duo parties get lighter scaling support
- The player chooses an opening approach:
  - Athletics rush
  - Stealth flank
  - Intimidation warning
- On victory:
  - clue: the goblins carry Ashen Brand markings
  - clue: the raiders answer to a hobgoblin sergeant tied to Ashfall Watch
  - extra reward: `25 XP`, `15 gp`
  - Tolan can be recruited immediately or left waiting at the inn
- Post-ambush side branches:
  - after the second wave, the cleared Emberway scene reopens instead of auto-entering Iron Hollow
  - unlocked side branches use plain action labels rather than redundant `[PUZZLE]`, `[PARLEY]`, or `[SOCIAL]` tags
  - side-branch returns travel to `phandalin_hub` without recording the side detour as the next backtrack target
  - Iron Hollow backtracking skips resolved Emberway side-detour nodes and points back to the main Emberway route
  - `Liar's Circle`: a four-statue logic puzzle that grants `Liar's Blessing` and `200 XP`, or applies `Liar's Curse`
  - `False Roadwarden Checkpoint`: a non-combat social stop with Deception, Insight, Persuasion, Intimidation, or Oren/Sabra/Garren proof
  - `False Tollstones`: a broken milemarker operation that changes if the player has `Liar's Blessing`

### Ashlamp Inn

- Bryn can be recruited with Persuasion DC `12`
- If Tolan was sent to recover instead of recruited on the road, he can be picked up here
- New regulars now anchor the inn scene:
  - Mara Ashlamp, who runs the common room and grants `The Marked Keg`
  - Jerek Harl, whose grief and anger now anchor `Bring Back Dain's Name`
  - Sella Quill, a singer who grants `Songs for the Missing`
  - Old Tam Veller, a ruin-minded prospector who still remembers honest route details
  - Nera Doss, a courier whose split lip leads into `Quiet Table, Sharp Knives`
- The Ashlamp Inn now supports:
  - an inn sabotage investigation around a chalk-marked keg
  - Jerek's missing-brother route quest, which ties Ashlamp grief directly to Ashfall Watch
  - a memory-ballad quest built from Jerek, Tam, and Nera's true details
  - a quiet-table whisper scheme that can roll into a skill-resolved barfight
  - an upstairs quiet-room reward scene that decodes stolen courier intel for later Ashfall and Emberhall use
  - a memorial follow-up where Sella's song changes once Dain Harl's fate is brought home
  - `Liar's Blessing` options in the keg, quiet-table, and quiet-room scenes
- Ashlamp's inn rewards now echo into Act 2:
  - `Harl Road-Knot` opens a special route-reading option at Stonehollow Dig
  - the quiet-room courier intel opens a special order-seizure option at Black Lake and is named during the claims council

### Shrine

- If Elira was not recruited at Wayside or Greywake, she appears at Iron Hollow's Lantern Shrine.
- Early failed recruitment attempts do not lock her out.
- If `elira_phandalin_fallback_pending` is set, asking her to join in Iron Hollow recruits her without another skill gate.
- If the player has no early Elira fallback and has not helped her, the normal recruitment check remains Persuasion DC `8`.

## Post-Combat Random Encounter Chains

- `Wounded Messenger`
  - a successful rescue sets up `Messenger Returns`, where the same courier can come back later with coin, healing supplies, and more road intel
- `Smuggler Cookfire`
  - if the camp is disrupted, it can unlock `Smuggler Revenge Squad`
  - if Bryn's personal quest is active, the cookfire can also expose her old cache
- `Abandoned Cottage`
  - once Bryn's cache trail is live, the cellar holdout can point toward `Emberhall`

## Debugging Pointers

- Enemy special behavior is keyed by `archetype`, so a renamed enemy still uses the base archetype logic
- Companion scene support only activates when the companion is in the active party and has disposition `6+`
- Great-threshold companion combat openers are separate from scene-support bonuses, so a companion can matter both in the room setup and again when initiative starts
- Quest completion is mostly flag-driven, so a missing `completion_flag` is often more important than a missing journal entry
- The same companion can be offered from multiple story branches, but `has_companion()` prevents duplicate recruitment
