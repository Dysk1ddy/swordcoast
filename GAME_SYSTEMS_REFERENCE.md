## Combat Flow

### Turn structure

- Each turn starts with `1` action and `1` bonus action
- Some abilities add or trade on top of that:
  - Fighter Action Surge grants one extra action
  - Monk Flurry of Blows, Patient Defense, and Step of the Wind use bonus action and ki
  - Rogue Cunning Action uses bonus action
  - Off-hand attack requires the Attack action first
- Dodge is a full action
- Trying to flee usually costs an action and uses Stealth vs DC `13`
- Free flee can be created by Step of the Wind or Cunning Action dash/disengage

### Initiative

- Initiative = d20 + DEX modifier + initiative bonuses + encounter hero/enemy bonus
- Tie sorting prefers higher DEX and then heroes over enemies

### Criticals

- Normal critical threshold: `20`
- Fighter with Improved Critical: `19-20`
- Criticals double the dice count in the rolled expression

### Sneak Attack

- Rogue Sneak Attack is active if another conscious hero is present and the target is conscious
- It currently triggers on weapon attacks when the computed attack advantage state is not negative
- Damage:
  - Levels 1-2: `1d6`
  - Levels 3-4: `2d6`

### Off-hand rules

- Requires light melee weapons in both hands
- No ranged weapons
- No two-handed weapons
- Off-hand damage does not include positive ability modifier

| Divine Smite | Paladin | attack rider, 1 spell slot | adds `2d8` radiant on a weapon hit |
| Channel Divinity | Cleric level 2+ | action, 1 use | `2d8` radiant, applies Stunned 1 |
| Cunning Action | Rogue level 2+ | bonus action | hide for Invisible 2 on success, or create flee opening |
| Help a Downed Ally | any hero | action | Medicine check DC `10`; on success target returns at 1 HP, on failure target stabilizes |

### Spell timing rule

- If a bonus-action spell is cast, the turn blocks non-cantrip action spells
- If a leveled action spell is cast, the turn blocks bonus-action spellcasting
- Cantrip-style attacks like Fire Bolt, Sacred Flame, Produce Flame, Vicious Mockery, and Eldritch Blast remain available as actions

## Status Effects

| Status | Main effect |
| --- | --- |
| Surprised | loses turn once |
| Blinded | attack disadvantage, helps attackers hit, hurts some checks |
| Charmed | cannot make hostile actions |
| Deafened | hurts hearing-based Perception checks |
| Exhaustion | skill disadvantage at 1+, attack penalty at 2+, save disadvantage at 3+ |
| Frightened | general d20 disadvantage pressure |
| Grappled | blocks movement, attack disadvantage |
| Incapacitated | cannot act |
| Invisible | grants attack advantage until broken by hostile action |
| Paralyzed | cannot act, auto-fails STR/DEX saves |
| Petrified | cannot act, auto-fails STR/DEX saves, halves incoming damage |
| Poisoned | general d20 disadvantage pressure |
| Burning | takes `1d6` fire at end of turn |
| Acid-Burned | takes `1d4` acid at end of turn, `-1 AC` |
| Reeling | `-2 attack` |
| Prone | `-2 AC`, melee attackers gain advantage, ranged attackers take disadvantage |
| Restrained | `-2 AC`, attack disadvantage, blocks movement, DEX save disadvantage |
| Emboldened | `+2 attack`, `+1 saves` |
| Blessed | `+1 attack`, `+2 saves` |
| Cursed | `-1 attack`, `-1 saves`, not marked combat-only |
| Resist Fire / Cold / Lightning / Poison | grants matching damage resistance |
| Stunned | cannot act |
| Unconscious | represented when current HP is 0 and not dead |

## Enemy-Independent Damage And Survival Rules

- Resistances halve incoming matching damage
- Temporary HP absorbs damage before current HP
- Fire resistance can come from Tiefling ancestry or item/status resistance
- Poison resistance can come from Dwarf ancestry or item/status resistance
- Dropping a hero to 0 HP starts death-save state
- Hitting a hero already at 0 HP causes a death-save failure instead of normal HP loss
- Enemies die immediately at 0 HP
- After combat, living heroes at 0 HP recover to 1 HP automatically

### Death saves

- DC `10`
- Natural `1`: two failures
- Natural `20`: stand up at `1` HP
- `3` successes: stabilize at `0`
- `3` failures: die

## Items, Resting, And Inventory

### Shared inventory

- Inventory is party-shared
- Carrying capacity is computed from the party
- Weight and supply points are tracked
- Equipment can be assigned to any company member

### Resting

- Short rests per long rest: `2`
- Short rest:
  - heals each living party member for `1d(hit die) + CON mod`, minimum `1`
  - restores short-rest resources like Second Wind, Action Surge, Channel Divinity, and ki
  - Arcane Recovery and Natural Recovery restore `1` spell slot on short rest
- Long rest:
  - costs `12` supply points
  - fully restores HP and resources for living members
  - resets short rests to `2`
  - clears temporary combat conditions
  - reduces Exhaustion by `1`

### Consumable timing

- Drinking a healing potion yourself in combat is a bonus action
- Using an item on someone else in combat is an action
- Scroll of Revivify works at camp on dead companions only
- The current item implementation supports healing, temp HP, revive HP, spell slot restoration, poison cure, condition clearing, and condition application

### Item catalog

- The full generated item reference already lives in `ITEM_CATALOG.md`
- Use that file for concrete weights, rarities, acquisition sources, weapon properties, armor entries, consumables, and scroll effects

## Notes For Debugging

- Many race and class feature tags are descriptive identifiers, while only a subset have hard-coded effects
- Enemy behavior is driven more by `archetype` checks than by generic feature tags
- Companion relationship bonuses stack into the same bonus channels used by gear and level progression
- Character creation stores a few legacy display names like `Healing Potion`, but active gameplay inventory uses normalized item ids like `potion_healing`
