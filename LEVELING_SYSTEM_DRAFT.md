# Leveling System Draft

Last updated: 2026-04-15

This document is a hybrid progression draft for the text-based Python DnD game. It takes its backbone from official Dungeons & Dragons 5e progression and uses Baldur's Gate 3 as the model for feat cadence, subclass timing, and class choice density.

This is intentionally written as an implementation-facing design note, not just lore. The goal is to make later coding work straightforward.

## Design Goals

- Extend progression from level 4 to level 8.
- Use the official D&D XP curve so levels feel earned.
- Keep party XP shared across the whole roster.
- Level all party members together when the shared threshold is reached.
- Let new companions auto-scale to the current party level on recruitment.
- Replace flat "+1 style" upgrades with real choice points: subclasses, feats, spells, passives, resources, and class actions.
- Use BG3-style feat selection at levels 4 and 8.
- Keep the system deep, but still implementable in a text game.

## Reference Backbone

### Official D&D used for the backbone

- Character advancement XP thresholds.
- Core class progression through level 8.
- Core spell lists through spell level 4.
- Core feature timing such as Extra Attack, subclass unlocks, Channel Divinity, Wild Shape, Metamagic, Invocations, and Arcane Tradition features.

### BG3 used for the game feel

- Feat menu and feat names.
- Subclass timing and subclass roster.
- Choice density on level-up.
- "Everyone gets a real build decision" philosophy.
- Shared-party feel where companions can stay relevant without falling behind.

## Core Party Rules

### Shared XP

- Keep one `party_xp` value for the whole save.
- When `party_xp` reaches a threshold, the player and all recruited companions gain the new level.
- This matches the current game's direction and keeps narrative party members from lagging behind.

### Simultaneous Level-Up

- When a threshold is hit, resolve level-up for the player, all active companions, and all camp companions.

Recommended order:

1. Raise everyone's level number.
2. Apply hit point gain.
3. Unlock new class resources and passive features.
4. Resolve subclass choice if the class reaches its subclass level and has no subclass yet.
5. Resolve new spells or class options.
6. Resolve feat choice if the level grants one.
7. Refill newly unlocked resources.

### New Companion Auto-Scaling

When a new companion joins:

1. Set `target_level = player.level`.
2. If the companion is below that level, auto-run every missed level-up.
3. Apply all missed HP gains, spell slots, class features, subclass features, feats, and passives.
4. Use a companion build template for automatic choices. Template fields should include preferred subclass, fighting style, cantrips, spell picks by level, feats, and invocations or metamagic.
5. After catch-up, fully restore HP and resources so the companion joins ready to use.

Recommended rule:

- Player-controlled protagonist gets manual choices.
- Story companions auto-pick from templates by default.
- Optional future camp feature: "review companion build" to let the player adjust them later.

## XP Thresholds: Level 1 to 8

These totals follow official D&D character advancement.

| Level | Total XP | XP Needed From Previous Level | Proficiency Bonus |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| 1 | 0 | 0 | +2 |
| 2 | 300 | 300 | +2 |
| 3 | 900 | 600 | +2 |
| 4 | 2,700 | 1,800 | +2 |
| 5 | 6,500 | 3,800 | +3 |
| 6 | 14,000 | 7,500 | +3 |
| 7 | 23,000 | 9,000 | +3 |
| 8 | 34,000 | 11,000 | +3 |

Recommended code update:

```python
LEVEL_XP_THRESHOLDS = {
    1: 0,
    2: 300,
    3: 900,
    4: 2700,
    5: 6500,
    6: 14000,
    7: 23000,
    8: 34000,
}
```

## Level-Up Choice Rules

### Global Rules

- Levels 4 and 8 always offer a feat choice.
- The feat menu should include `Ability Improvement` as a standard option.
- Ability scores still cap at 20 unless a later system explicitly overrides that.
- Full casters should feel stronger at levels 3, 5, and 7 because those unlock new spell levels.
- Martial classes should feel stronger at level 5 because of Extra Attack.
- Subclasses should define build identity, not just grant a flat stat bump.

### Optional BG3 Parity Rules Worth Keeping

- Fighter gets an extra feat at level 6.
- Rogue gets an extra feat at level 10, which is outside the current cap.

## Subclass Unlock Timing

Use BG3 timing for subclass selection:

| Class | Subclass Choice Level |
| --- | ---: |
| Barbarian | 3 |
| Bard | 3 |
| Cleric | 1 |
| Druid | 2 |
| Fighter | 3 |
| Monk | 3 |
| Paladin | 3 |
| Ranger | 3 |
| Rogue | 3 |
| Sorcerer | 1 |
| Warlock | 1 |
| Wizard | 2 |

## Spellcasting Progression Templates

Use BG3's spellcasting concept instead of a bespoke per-class slot table. This makes future class data cleaner and lines up with the way BG3 handles full casters, half casters, one-third casters, prepared casters, and warlocks.

### BG3 Spellcasting Concepts

- Cantrips do not consume spell slots and can usually be cast at will.
- Most spell slots refresh on a long rest.
- Warlock Pact Magic slots refresh on a short or long rest.
- Casting a spell with a higher slot upcasts it if the spell supports scaling.
- Spells cast with higher slots count as the level of the slot spent, even if they gain no other benefit.

### BG3 Known And Prepared Spell Rules

- Known-spell casters in BG3: Bard, Ranger, Sorcerer, Warlock, Eldritch Knight, Arcane Trickster, and Wizard.
- Wizards are still special because they also learn extra spells by scribing scrolls.
- Prepared casters in BG3: Cleric, Druid, Paladin, and Wizard.
- Prepared spell count in BG3 is `spellcasting ability modifier + class level`, minimum 1.
- Always-prepared spells from class features, domains, or oaths should not count against prepared capacity.

### BG3 Effective Spellcaster Level

BG3 uses one universal Spellcasting slot table based on effective spellcaster level, or `ESL`.

- Full casters use `ESL = class level`.
- Half casters use `ESL = ceil(class level / 2)`.
- One-third casters use `ESL = ceil(class level / 3)`.
- If multiclassing is ever added later, BG3 sums the fractional spellcaster levels from each Spellcasting class and rounds the total down.

### BG3 Universal Spellcasting Slot Table

This table is copied from BG3's general spellcasting rules and then trimmed to the current level-8 target.

| ESL | 1st | 2nd | 3rd | 4th |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| 1 | 2 | 0 | 0 | 0 |
| 2 | 3 | 0 | 0 | 0 |
| 3 | 4 | 2 | 0 | 0 |
| 4 | 4 | 3 | 0 | 0 |
| 5 | 4 | 3 | 2 | 0 |
| 6 | 4 | 3 | 3 | 0 |
| 7 | 4 | 3 | 3 | 1 |
| 8 | 4 | 3 | 3 | 2 |

### Single-Class BG3 Slot Outcomes For This Project

| Class Type | Levels 1-8 ESL Mapping | Resulting Highest Spell Slot By Level 8 |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Full caster | 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 | 4th |
| Half caster | 1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 4, 4 | 2nd |
| One-third caster | 0, 0, 1, 2, 2, 2, 3, 3 | 2nd |

### BG3 Pact Magic Progression

Warlocks do not use the universal spellcasting slot table. They use Pact Magic.

- Pact slots are always the highest spell level the warlock can currently cast.
- Pact slots refresh on a short rest.
- Warlock spells are automatically upcast to the current pact slot level.

| Warlock Level | Pact Slots | Pact Slot Level |
| --- | ---: | ---: |
| 1 | 1 | 1 |
| 2 | 2 | 1 |
| 3 | 2 | 2 |
| 4 | 2 | 2 |
| 5 | 2 | 3 |
| 6 | 2 | 3 |
| 7 | 2 | 4 |
| 8 | 2 | 4 |

### Recommended Implementation Rule

For this game, store spell slots as a dictionary by slot level, for example:

```python
spell_slots = {1: 4, 2: 3, 3: 2, 4: 0}
```

Then derive those values from:

- `class_name`
- `level`
- `subclass`
- `is_warlock`

This is cleaner than adding `+1 spell slot` on every level-up, because it keeps the data in line with BG3 and avoids drift when companions auto-scale to party level.

## BG3 Feat Catalog

All classes can choose one feat at levels 4 and 8. Fighter should also get a level 6 feat if we want closer BG3 parity.

The effects below are paraphrased for implementation notes.

| Moderately Armoured | +1 STR or DEX and gain Medium Armour and Shield proficiency. | Requires Light Armour proficiency. |

## Recommended Companion Build Templates

These are suggested default auto-picks so companions can scale instantly without asking the player ten questions in a row.

### Auto-pick priorities

- Martial frontline: durability feat first, then damage feat.
- Ranged martial: accuracy or ranged damage feat first.
- Full caster: casting stat feat first, then concentration or utility.
- Support companion: healing or control spells before niche utility.

### Suggested feat preferences by archetype

- Barbarian: `Great Weapon Master`, `Tough`, `Savage Attacker`, `Alert`
- Fighter: `Great Weapon Master`, `Sharpshooter`, `Polearm Master`, `Alert`
- Monk: `Tavern Brawler`, `Mobile`, `Alert`, `Tough`
- Paladin: `Great Weapon Master`, `War Caster`, `Tough`, `Alert`
- Ranger: `Sharpshooter`, `Alert`, `Mobile`, `Ability Improvement`
- Rogue: `Alert`, `Mobile`, `Lucky`, `Ability Improvement`
- Bard: `Ability Improvement`, `War Caster`, `Alert`, `Lucky`
- Cleric: `War Caster`, `Ability Improvement`, `Resilient`, `Alert`
- Druid: `War Caster`, `Ability Improvement`, `Alert`, `Resilient`
- Sorcerer: `Ability Improvement`, `War Caster`, `Alert`, `Spell Sniper`
- Warlock: `Ability Improvement`, `Spell Sniper`, `Alert`, `War Caster`
- Wizard: `Ability Improvement`, `War Caster`, `Alert`, `Lucky`

## Suggested Data Model Additions

Add or refactor these fields on `Character` later:

- `subclass: str`
- `feats: list[str]`
- `passives: list[str]`
- `actions: list[str]`
- `bonus_actions: list[str]`
- `reactions: list[str]`
- `spellbook: list[str]`
- `known_spells: list[str]`
- `prepared_spells: list[str]`
- `cantrips: list[str]`
- `fighting_style: str`
- `invocations: list[str]`
- `metamagic: list[str]`
- `pact_boon: str`
- `resource_progression: dict[str, int]`
- `build_template_id: str`
- `level_choice_log: list[dict[str, str]]`

## Suggested Implementation Order

### Phase 1

- Extend XP thresholds to 8.
- Add feat support.
- Add subclass field.
- Add a generic choice resolver for level-up.

### Phase 2

- Replace the current static level 2 to 4 feature table with per-class level 1 to 8 progression data.
- Add spell slot templates.
- Add spell list data files.

### Phase 3

- Add companion build templates.
- Add recruit-time catch-up leveling.
- Add camp review and respec style interface later if desired.

## Concrete Notes For This Repo

- The current game already uses shared party XP, which is the right foundation.
- The biggest missing pieces are subclass state, feats, spell selection, and class-specific choice tracking.
- The current `CLASS_LEVEL_PROGRESSION` data should eventually become a deeper structure with fields such as `level`, `features`, `resource_changes`, `subclass_choice`, `feat_choice`, `spell_choice`, `prepared_spell_cap`, `known_spell_delta`, `cantrip_delta`, and `choice_templates`.

Recommended future shape:

```python
CLASS_LEVEL_PROGRESSION["Wizard"][5] = {
    "features": ["level_3_spells"],
    "spell_slot_progression": {"1": 4, "2": 3, "3": 2},
    "spell_choice": {"learn": 2, "max_spell_level": 3},
}
```
