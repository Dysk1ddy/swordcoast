# Sword Coast Story Content Summary

This file is a repo-wide story pass for the current text-based Python DnD game. It is based on the root reference markdown files, the live game flow in `dnd_game/`, the current map system, companion and camp data, random encounter content, the Act 2 scaffold, and a quick scan of the Android and draft folders.

## What Is Live, Planned, Or Legacy

- Live fully playable campaign: Act 1, `Ashes on the Triboar Trail`.
- Live partially playable scaffold: Act 2, `Echoes Beneath the Sword Mountains`.
- Roadmap only: Act 3, `The Jewel and the Chasm`.
- Important implementation note: the live Act 1 route uses `MapSystemMixin`, so some older linear Act 1 scene code is effectively superseded by the room-based map version.
- The `android_port/` folder is a legacy mirror of an older, shorter Act 1 flow. It does not add unique new branches beyond the current desktop version.
- The `dnd_game/drafts/map_system/` folder is design support, not a separate playable story branch, but it helps explain the intended room-by-room structure of Act 1.

### Title-screen lore content

- Background lore.
- Ability and skill notes.
- Feature and condition notes.
- Appendix-style deity, faction, and planar notes.
- Campaign roadmap notes.

### Neverwinter briefing

Mira Thann gives the core premise:

- Caravans to Phandalin are vanishing.
- Miners are being shaken down.
- The `Ashen Brand` is using old frontier ruins for cover.

The player can ask:

- `How is Neverwinter holding together these days?`
- `Tell me what matters most about Phandalin before I ride.`
- `How dangerous is this Ashen Brand, really?`

Before leaving, the player can make one final preparation:

- `Investigation`: review caravan ledgers.
- `Religion`: seek a road prayer and blessing.
- `Persuasion`: loosen tongues among teamsters and dockhands.
- Or skip the detour.

The player also chooses an early companion:

- `Kaelis Starling`
- `Rhogar Valeguard`

### High Road ambush

### Act 1 ending and foreshadowing

When `Varyn Sable` falls:

- Act 1 now records one of three ending tiers:
  - `clean_victory`
  - `costly_victory`
  - `fractured_victory`
- That ending state is shaped by `Town Fear`, `Ashen Strength`, `Survivors Saved`, and strained late-act moral choices around Bryn, Elira, and Rhogar.
- Phandalin can leave the act relieved, exhausted, or still visibly cracked by what it took to win.
- Varyn's ledgers point toward older powers beneath the Sword Mountains.
- `Wave Echo Cave` becomes the obvious next narrative destination, and the game records `act2_starting_pressure` for the next act.

## Act 1 Post-Combat Random Encounter Story Pool

These are optional side vignettes that can trigger after fights. They are not pure combat filler; they are small story moments with loot, checks, or small follow-up fights.

| Encounter | Setup |
| --- | --- |
| Locked Chest Under the Ferns | A traveler's chest is hidden beneath a fallen marker stone. |
| Abandoned Cottage | A soot-stained roadside cottage has a suspiciously newer cellar door. |
| Bandit Toll Line | A fake toll rope and sign block the road while voices wait out of sight. |
| Wounded Messenger | A messenger in torn livery is bleeding out behind a milepost. |
| Messenger Returns | A previously saved courier can come back later with a reward and more road intel. |
| Hunter's Snare | A taut roadside snare is waiting for a careless ankle. |
| Lone Wolf at the Kill | A wolf guards a carcass and a glinting torn purse. |
| Smuggler Cookfire | A hidden cookfire and tarp suggest smugglers camping just off-road. |
| Smuggler Revenge Squad | If the smugglers are disrupted, they can later come back with Ashen Brand backing. |
| Shrine of Tymora | A weathered lucky-road shrine still stands under an oak. |
| Half-Sunk Satchel | A satchel is trapped in runoff water in a muddy ditch. |
| Ruined Wayhouse | A roofless wayhouse hides fresh scrape marks around its cellar trapdoor. |
| Scavenger Cart | A broken cart lies in the ditch with one useful-looking axle pin still jammed in place. |
| Loose Flagstones | Raised roadside flagstones look like they are hiding a cache. |
| Frightened Draft Horse | A panicked draft horse is tangled in broken trace lines. |
| Rain Barrel Cache | A weighted rain barrel sounds like it hides more than water. |
| Watchfire Embers | A just-abandoned watchfire still holds warm bedroll hollows. |
| Broken Milestone | A shattered milestone shows fresh pry marks from recent scavengers. |

General pattern:

- Most of these offer three choices.
- The options are usually a careful skill route, a bolder forceful route, and a leave-it or escalate-it route.
- Outcomes can be loot, clue-like flavor, damage, or a short side fight.
- A few now chain forward into later road scenes or companion-quest payoffs:
  - `Wounded Messenger` -> `Messenger Returns`
  - `Smuggler Cookfire` -> `Smuggler Revenge Squad`
  - `Abandoned Cottage` can expose an `Emberhall` clue once Bryn's cache trail is live

## Act 2 Scaffold Story Content

Important status note:

- Act 2 is strongly documented and partially scaffolded in code, but it is not as fully live as the current Act 1 map route.
- The repo treats this as the intended next campaign arc, so it still matters for story summarization.

### Core Act 2 premise

Act 2 shifts the game from frontier cleanup into a layered expedition story:

- public conflict: who controls `Wave Echo Cave` and the claims around it,
- private conflict: the `Quiet Choir` is using the Forge and an obelisk shard as a listening instrument,
- emotional pressure: Phandalin is no longer just surviving bandits; it is deciding what kind of town it becomes while deeper horror pushes upward.

`Sister Caldra Voss` is framed as a cult theologian more than a greedy treasure hunter. Her story role is to prove that the mine is dangerous not only because it is valuable, but because it can answer the wrong kind of prayer.

### Campaign pressures

The Act 2 scaffold repeatedly tracks three pressures:

- `Town Stability`
  - how well Phandalin holds together politically and emotionally,
- `Route Control`
  - how secure the expedition roads, cuts, and approach lines are,
- `Whisper Pressure`
  - how much Quiet Choir influence, dread, and resonance contamination is spreading.

Act 1 carryover choices push these values:

- saving townsfolk and handling civic scenes feeds `Town Stability`,
- road and outpost wins feed `Route Control`,
- shrine and spiritual choices can lower `Whisper Pressure`,
- which companions were recruited also unlocks side arcs that shift later pressure.

### Opening structure

Act 2 opens with:

1. aftermath in `Phandalin`,
2. a `Stonehill Claims Council`,
3. a sponsor decision,
4. three early leads, of which any two can push the act to its midpoint.

At the `Stonehill Claims Council`, the player is not just hearing exposition. The scene is a political conversation about who gets to shape the expedition and how much of Phandalin's future gets traded away to make it happen.

### Sponsor choice

The player can align most strongly with one of three sponsor lanes:

- `Halia Thornton / Miner's Exchange`
  - stronger route and ambition,
  - but more dangerous whisper-side compromise,
- `Linene Graywind / Lionshield`
  - steadier practical support,
  - more balanced town and route gains,
- `Elira Dawnmantle and Daran Edermath / Warden lane`
  - more conscience-driven expedition posture,
  - helps town resilience and restrains whisper corruption.

This is a story choice, not just a stat pick. It defines who frames the mine: profit, preparedness, or moral stewardship.

### Early-route branch set

The player can pursue three early leads. Clearing any two unlocks the midpoint, but delaying the third permanently changes its tone.

#### Conyberry and Agatha's Circuit

Story function:

- reconnects the expedition to old Pact routes and older warnings,
- gives `Elira`-aligned spiritual context,
- determines whether the town reaches the midpoint with a clean warning or a damaged one.

Main conversation and choice texture:

- the player seeks `Agatha's` truth,
- the scene leans into grief, memory, and whether warnings can still be trusted after history has already failed once,
- key approaches use:
  - `Persuasion`,
  - `Religion`,
  - `Arcana`.

If delayed:

- the warning still exists,
- but it arrives late and fractured,
- making the midpoint feel more panicked and less prepared.

#### Neverwinter Wood Survey Camp

Story function:

- focuses on witnesses, sabotage traces, and how expedition truth can be erased before it reaches town,
- carries more grounded frontier-investigation energy than the ghostly `Conyberry` route.

Key approaches:

- `Stealth`,
- `Intimidation`,
- `Survival`.

If delayed:

- saboteurs have more time to clean up,
- evidence gets worse,
- the scene becomes less about prevention and more about salvage.

#### Stonehollow Dig

Story function:

- excavation rescue scene,
- survey-truth branch,
- recruitment entrance for `Nim Ardentglass`.

Key approaches:

- `Investigation`,
- `Athletics`,
- `Arcana`.

Its emotional core is not just "clear the dig." It is about whether knowledge comes back out of the earth in usable form, and whether scholars and delvers still matter as people instead of expendable assets.

If delayed:

- the cleanest survey notes are lost or degraded,
- the route picture is worse,
- `Nim` still can appear, but the rescue has a more damaged emotional register.

### Midpoint convergence: Sabotage Night

Once two early leads are cleared, the player can trigger `Sabotage Night`.

This is the act's first major convergence scene:

- town factions collide,
- earlier missing information starts to hurt,
- the player must choose what to protect first.

Priority options:

- hold the `Claims Hall`
  - `Persuasion`,
- save `Shrine Lane`
  - `Medicine`,
- hunt the infiltrator cell
  - `Perception`.

This is one of the strongest story-pressure moments in the repo because it forces a real "you cannot save everything at once" beat.

### Late-route branch set

Both late routes are required before the deep mine push, but their order matters.

#### Broken Prospect

Story function:

- secures the cleaner tactical approach,
- prioritizes route control over immediate prisoner rescue,
- is especially meaningful for `Tolan`'s survival-memory arc.

Key approaches:

- `History`,
- `Stealth`,
- `Religion`.

If taken first:

- the expedition line improves,
- but the `South Adit` captives suffer for the delay.

#### South Adit

Story function:

- prison-rescue route,
- direct confrontation with the Quiet Choir's human cost,
- recruitment entrance for `Irielle Ashwake`.

Key approaches:

- `Sleight of Hand`,
- `Intimidation`,
- `Medicine`.

If taken first:

- more captives live,
- but the rival route and claim pressure harden elsewhere.

This is one of the clearest moral forks in the campaign: save people first, or stabilize the path first.

### Final Wave Echo sequence

After both late routes, the act closes with three linked scenes.

#### Wave Echo Outer Galleries

Story function:

- the company finally commits to a real mine advance,
- the story tone shifts from frontier skirmish to deep-ruin pressure,
- the player proves the expedition can actually hold a line underground.

Key approaches:

- `Investigation`,
- `Survival`,
- `Athletics`.

#### Black Lake Causeway

This scene reframes the approach to the Forge around three priorities:

- reclaim the shrine
  - `Religion`,
- raid the barracks
  - `Stealth`,
- sabotage the causeway directly
  - `Athletics`.

It is effectively a last "what kind of victory do you want?" scene before the boss.

#### Forge of Spells

Story function:

- final confrontation with `Sister Caldra Voss`,
- reveal that the Forge has been turned into a listening lens,
- explicit handoff toward Act 3-scale cosmic danger.

Key confrontation routes:

- `Arcana`,
- `Persuasion`,
- immediate assault.

This scene matters narratively because winning does not fully solve the problem. It proves the mine is part of something older and that Caldra was listening for a deeper answer, and it now records which Forge subroutes were actually broken before the final confrontation.

### Act 2 epilogue states

The scaffold now records four final state families for the next act:

- town outcome:
  - `united`,
  - `holding`,
  - `fractured`,
- claims outcome:
  - `secured`,
  - `contested`,
  - `chaotic`,
- whisper outcome:
  - `contained`,
  - `lingering`,
  - `carried_out`,
- forge outcome:
  - route state:
    - `mastered`,
    - `broken`,
    - `partial`,
    - `direct`,
  - lens state:
    - `mapped`,
    - `shattered_blind`,
  - cleared subroutes:
    - stored as `act3_forge_subroutes_cleared` so later scenes can name which Forge lines the party actually broke.

This means Act 2 is designed less like a single fixed finale and more like a state-setting bridge into a darker Act 3, with sponsor fallout and later dialogue able to remember how thoroughly the Forge was actually unraveled.

## Act 2 Random Encounter Story Pool

There are two important Act 2 random-story layers in the repo.

### Documented Act 2-exclusive pool

`ACT2_CONTENT_REFERENCE.md` proposes a suspense-heavy pool built around expedition dread, cult traces, and mine folklore:

- `Silent Mule Train`
- `Lantern in the Wash`
- `Hushed Pilgrims`
- `Buried Wheel Rut`
- `Collapsed Watchfire`
- `Chalked Warning Stone`
- `Missing Voice at Camp`
- `Rope Across the Dark`
- `Blackwater Crossing`
- `Prospector's Last Joke`
- `Choir Under the Hill`
- `Broken Sending Tube`
- `Stone-Taster`
- `Shardfall Gleam`
- `Dust in the Bedroll`

These are framed as fast scenes that can resolve through protection, lore, investigation, or dread rather than always becoming combat.

### Implemented Act 2 scaffold pool in code

`dnd_game/gameplay/random_encounters.py` already includes a separate Act 2 post-combat pool with live scene text and three-option choices:

- `Echoing Supply Cache`
- `Whispering Lantern`
- `Collapsed Ore Sled`
- `Silent Prayer Wall`
- `Flooded Tool Chest`
- `Surveyor Ghostlight`
- `Stolen Claim Markers`
- `Blackwater Drifter`
- `Chain-Drag Tunnel`
- `Mushroom Bloom Hall`
- `Shattered Foreman Bell`
- `Hidden Prisoner Note`
- `Obsidian Shard Outcrop`
- `Broken Lift Cradle`
- `Hushed Campfire`

General pattern:

- choice 1 is usually a skill-based careful read of the scene,
- choice 2 is a quicker salvage play,
- choice 3 is to leave it alone and keep the route moving.

These scenes quietly carry a lot of story texture:

- old `Pact` labor history,
- Quiet Choir contamination,
- prisoner rumors,
- mine superstitions,
- moral pressure around what to touch and what to leave buried.

## Legacy, Duplicate, And Draft Story Material Elsewhere In The Repo

### Root markdown references

These files are useful canonical summaries or design targets:

- `README.md`
  - big-picture game premise and feature promises,
- `ACT1_CONTENT_REFERENCE.md`
  - approved Act 1 story map and quest flow,
- `ACT2_CONTENT_REFERENCE.md`
  - Act 2 design target and branching plan,
- `GAME_SYSTEMS_REFERENCE.md`
  - companion, camp, travel, and systems context that affects how story is delivered.

### Android port

`android_port/` mostly mirrors the earlier desktop story stack:

- same `Act 1` style opening structure,
- same broad chapter plan,
- not a separate campaign with new lore.

It is best treated as a duplicate implementation surface, not as extra canon.

### Draft map-system documents

The map draft docs under `dnd_game/drafts/map_system/` are useful because they explain intended room flow, unlock logic, and Act 1 route sequencing.

They are not separate branches of the story. They are design notes for the current playable Act 1 map structure.

### Title-screen lore codex

The game also carries a built-in lore reference surfaced from the title/menu layer:

- world primer,
- major faction context,
- class and race summaries,
- background summaries,
- companion summaries,
- story-so-far framing.

That content is more encyclopedia than scene-writing, but it is still part of the repo's narrative surface.

## Bottom Line

If you strip away combat and systems language, the repo currently tells three overlapping kinds of story:

1. `Playable Act 1`
   - a frontier rescue-and-stabilization campaign built around Phandalin, recruitable companions, layered town conversations, and a room-based approach to the Ashen Brand and `Varyn Sable`.
2. `Structured character identity`
   - race, class, background, and preset choices that all carry tone, opening flavor, and lore framing rather than being purely mechanical.
3. `Act 2 scaffold and future arc`
   - a claims-war expedition into `Wave Echo Cave`, with sponsor politics, rescue-versus-route choices, companion side arcs, `Sister Caldra Voss`, and early cosmic-horror escalation.

So the game already has a substantial amount of story material even where the campaign is not fully finished:

- origin fantasy,
- town NPC conversation trees,
- recruitable companion banter,
- camp talks,
- branching quest priorities,
- end-of-act foreshadowing,
- and a clearly planned sequel act with its own moral and political shape.
