# Spells, Abilities, Passives, And Feats Reference

Last updated: 2026-04-15

This document is a mechanical reference for the level-1-to-8 progression draft. It is written for implementation work in this repo, not for player-facing rulebook text.

Important note:

- Spell and feature text below is paraphrased from official D&D Basic Rules material and BG3 reference pages.
- I am intentionally not reproducing long rules text verbatim.
- Where tabletop D&D and BG3 differ, I call that out in a `BG3 note`.
- The scope here is the content most useful for this game's level-8 roadmap: the BG3 feat list, the core class abilities and passives that matter through level 8, and a high-priority spell pool for implementation.

## Source Backbone

### Official D&D sources used

- D&D Beyond Basic Rules (2014) class rules
- D&D Beyond Basic Rules (2014) spell rules and spell entries

### BG3 sources used

- BG3 feat list
- BG3 spell system page
- BG3 class pages for spell progression and class-feature timing
- BG3 action pages for selected class actions and passives

## Core Spellcasting Rules

### Shared Concepts

- Cantrips are level-0 spells and normally do not consume spell slots.
- Spell attacks use `d20 + proficiency bonus + spellcasting ability modifier`.
- Spell save DC is normally `8 + proficiency bonus + spellcasting ability modifier`.
- Concentration only supports one active concentration spell at a time.
- Taking damage can break concentration with a Constitution saving throw against DC 10 or half the damage taken, whichever is higher.
- Long rests normally restore spell slots.
- Warlock pact slots also refresh on short rest.
- Upcasting uses a higher-level spell slot to strengthen a spell if the spell supports scaling.

### BG3 Known And Prepared Spell Model

| Casting model | Classes | Rule |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Known spells | Bard, Ranger, Sorcerer, Warlock, Eldritch Knight, Arcane Trickster, Wizard | Learn spells on level-up. Most can replace one known spell on level-up. |
| Prepared spells | Cleric, Druid, Paladin, Wizard | Prepare a subset of available spells outside combat. |
| Prepared count | Cleric, Druid, Paladin, Wizard | `spellcasting ability modifier + class level`, minimum 1. |
| Always prepared | Domain, oath, subclass, race, or feature-granted spells | Do not count against prepared capacity. |

### BG3 Effective Spellcaster Level

BG3 uses a universal spell-slot table for classes with the `Spellcasting` feature.

| Caster type | BG3 rule |
| --- | --- |
| Full caster | `ESL = class level` |
| Half caster | `ESL = ceil(class level / 2)` |
| One-third caster | `ESL = ceil(class level / 3)` |
| Multiclass spellcasting | Sum the fractional spellcaster levels from Spellcasting classes, then round the total down |

### BG3 Universal Spellcasting Slot Table

| ESL | 1st | 2nd | 3rd | 4th |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| 1 | 2 | 0 | 0 | 0 |
| 2 | 3 | 0 | 0 | 0 |
| 3 | 4 | 2 | 0 | 0 |
| 4 | 4 | 3 | 0 | 0 |
| 5 | 4 | 3 | 2 | 0 |
| 6 | 4 | 3 | 3 | 0 |
| 7 | 4 | 3 | 3 | 1 |
| 8 | 4 | 3 | 3 | 2 |

### BG3 Pact Magic

| Warlock level | Pact slots | Slot level | Refresh |
| --- | ---: | ---: | --- |
| 1 | 1 | 1 | Short or long rest |
| 2 | 2 | 1 | Short or long rest |
| 3 | 2 | 2 | Short or long rest |
| 4 | 2 | 2 | Short or long rest |
| 5 | 2 | 3 | Short or long rest |
| 6 | 2 | 3 | Short or long rest |
| 7 | 2 | 4 | Short or long rest |
| 8 | 2 | 4 | Short or long rest |

Key behavior:

- Warlocks do not use the normal Spellcasting slot table for their class slots.
- Warlock spells are cast at the current pact-slot level.
- This means lower-level warlock spells are automatically upcast when possible.

## Class Resource Scaling To Level 8

This section condenses the class-resource information most useful for implementation. Unless noted otherwise, values below are the BG3 model. Where D&D tabletop differs, that is called out in the notes.

### Martial And Hybrid Resource Tables

| Class / resource | L1 | L2 | L3 | L4 | L5 | L6 | L7 | L8 | Rest refresh | Notes |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | --- | --- |
| Barbarian Rage Charges | 2 | 2 | 3 | 3 | 3 | 4 | 4 | 4 | Long rest | BG3 rage adds +2 damage through level 8 and forbids spellcasting/concentration while raging. |
| Bardic Inspiration Charges | 3 | 3 | 3 | 3 | 4 | 4 | 4 | 5 | Long rest until level 5, then short rest | Bardic Inspiration die is `d6` until level 4, `d8` at levels 5-9. |
| Cleric Channel Divinity Charges | 0 | 1 | 1 | 1 | 1 | 2 | 2 | 2 | Short or long rest | Domain actions also spend these charges. |
| Druid Wild Shape Charges | 0 | 2 | 2 | 2 | 2 | 2 | 2 | 2 | Short rest | Base BG3 druid uses 2 charges per short rest; Circle of the Moon upgrades action economy and forms. |
| Fighter Second Wind | 1 | 1 | 1 | 1 | 1 | 1 | 1 | 1 | Short rest | Heals `1d10 + fighter level`. |
| Fighter Action Surge | 0 | 1 | 1 | 1 | 1 | 1 | 1 | 1 | Short rest | Grants one additional action. |
| Monk Ki Points | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 | 9 | Short rest | BG3 monks start with ki at level 1, unlike 2014 tabletop monks. |
| Paladin Lay on Hands Charges | 3 | 3 | 3 | 4 | 4 | 4 | 4 | 4 | Long rest | BG3 differs from tabletop pool math. Each charge heals `2 x paladin level`. Cure disease/poison costs 2 charges. |
| Paladin Channel Oath Charges | 0 | 0 | 1 | 1 | 1 | 1 | 1 | 1 | Short or long rest | Oath actions use this pool. |
| Rogue Sneak Attack Dice | 1d6 | 1d6 | 2d6 | 2d6 | 3d6 | 3d6 | 4d6 | 4d6 | Per turn / per round timing | BG3 allows direct-use actions and post-hit reactions; it effectively refreshes once per round. |
| Sorcery Points | 0 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 | Long rest | Used for Metamagic and spell-slot conversion. |
| Warlock Invocations Known | 0 | 2 | 2 | 2 | 3 | 3 | 4 | 4 | Permanent choices | BG3 invocations are normally fixed unless the character is respecced. |

### Prepared Spell Capacity

| Class | Prepared spell rule in BG3 | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Cleric | `cleric level + WIS modifier`, minimum 1 | Domain spells are always prepared and should not consume capacity. |
| Druid | `druid level + WIS modifier`, minimum 1 | Circle spells or feature spells should not consume capacity. |
| Paladin | `paladin level + CHA modifier`, minimum 1 | Oath spells are always prepared and should not consume capacity. |
| Wizard | `wizard level + INT modifier`, minimum 1 | Wizard also learns extra spells through scribing, then prepares a subset. |

### Known Spell Progression Notes

| Class | BG3 model through level 8 |
| --- | --- |
| Bard | Starts with 4 spells known at level 1 and generally gains 1 additional known spell each level through 8. |
| Sorcerer | Starts with 2 spells known at level 1 and reaches 9 known spells by level 8. |
| Warlock | Starts with 2 spells known at level 1 and gains 1 additional known spell per level through 8. |
| Ranger | Known-spell half-caster progression; learns slowly and benefits from careful curation. |
| Eldritch Knight / Arcane Trickster | One-third caster progression with restricted school access early on. |

## Common Combat Conditions Referenced In This File

| Condition / state | Gameplay meaning |
| --- | --- |
| Advantage | Roll two d20s and use the higher result. |
| Disadvantage | Roll two d20s and use the lower result. |
| Concentration | You can maintain only one concentration spell at a time; taking damage can break it. |
| Charmed | Usually cannot target the charmer with attacks or harmful abilities and is vulnerable to charm synergy effects. |
| Frightened | Often imposes disadvantage and prevents moving closer to the fear source. |
| Paralysed | The creature is incapacitated, fails STR/DEX saves, attack rolls against it have advantage, and nearby hits can crit. |
| Stunned | The creature is incapacitated, cannot move, automatically fails STR/DEX saves, and attacks against it have advantage. |
| Invisible | Attack rolls against the creature have disadvantage and its own attacks often gain advantage until invisibility breaks. |
| Surprised | Loses opening-tempo options at the start of combat. BG3 feat text often references immunity to Surprise rather than tabletop surprise rounds. |
| Difficult Terrain | Movement costs extra distance. |
| Opportunity Attack | A reaction strike when a hostile creature leaves melee reach unless prevented by a feature or spell. |

## Core Class Abilities And Passives

These entries focus on the core actions, passives, and resources that matter for the level-1-to-8 system. Subclass-only features are called out where they define a build path, but this is not yet a full subclass encyclopedia.
